            <h1>I like a cat.</h1>
            <p>
                The cat is a domestic species of small carnivorus mammal.<br>
                It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.<br>
                A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.<br>
                Dmestic cats are valued by humans for eompanionship and their ability to hunt rodents.<br>
                About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registeries.<br>
